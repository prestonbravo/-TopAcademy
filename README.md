Task 1: Display one verse of your favorite poem or song on the screen, indicating the author or performer. Use the escape sequence for formatting.

Task 2: Display the verse "Every hunter wants ..." so that each "color" starts with a new line and the appropriate number of tabs.

Task 3: Write an advertisement for the sale of something and display it on the screen, in the form it should have been printed. For example: I will sell puppies. Breed: Rottweiler. Body.: 222-22-22 222 | 222 | 22 | 22 | 22 etc. | 22 |

Task 4: Three resistances R1, R2, R3 are set. Calculate the value of the resistance R0 using the formula: 1 / R0 = 1 / R1 + 1 / R2 + 1 / R3. Control example: R1=2, R2=4, R3=8 RO = 1.142857

Task 5: For a given circumference, find the area of the circle using the formula S = piR2, calculate the radius from the circumference formula: L = 2pi R Note pi = 3.14

Task 6: Calculate the distance traveled in rectilinear equidistant motion using the formula 5 = vt + (at2) / 2, where ѵ is speed, t is time, and acceleration.

Task 7: The user enters the distance to the airport and the time it takes to get there from the keyboard. Calculate the speed at which he needs to go.

Task 8: The user enters the start and end time of a telephone conversation (hours, minutes and seconds) from the keyboard. Calculate the cost of a conversation if the cost of a minute is 30 kopecks.

Task 9: The user enters the distance, fuel consumption per 100 km and the cost of three types of fuel from the keyboard. Display a comparison table with the cost of a trip on different types of fuel.

Homework No. 2 of the course "Fundamentals of programming in C++", the topic "Statements" from Top Academy.Teacher: Zelik Alexander Maksimovich

Task 1. Write a program that calculates the sum of integers from a to 500 (the value of a is entered from the keyboard).

Task 2. Write a program that requests two integers x and y, after which it calculates and outputs the value of x to the power of y.

Task 3. Find the arithmetic mean of all integers from 1 to 1000.

Task 4. Find the product of all integers from a to 20 (the value of a is entered from the keyboard: 1 < = a < = 20).

Task 5. Write a program that displays a multiplication table by k, where k is the number of the variant. For example, for the 7th option:

7 x 2 = 14

7 x 3 = 21

Task 6. Display all the numbers from zero to the number entered by the user.

Task 7. The user enters two units of the range, display all the numbers from this range. Provide that the user can enter the range boundaries in any order.

print all even numbers from the range.

print all odd numbers from the range.

print all the numbers that are multiples of seven.

Task 8. The user enters two boundaries of the range. Calculate the sum of all the numbers in the range.

Task 9. The user enters numbers using the keyboard. Calculate their sum and display it on the screen as soon as the user enters zero.

Task 1. The user enters a number greater than zero from the keyboard, it is necessary to print all its digits, starting from the end.Note. For example, the user entered the number 12345. The number on the contrary should appear on the screen — 54321.

Task 2. The user enters a number from the keyboard, it is necessary to show the sum of its digits on the screen. Note. For example, the user entered the number 12345. A message should appear on the screen stating that the sum of the digits of the number is 15.

Task 3. On the first day, the snail crawled 15 cm. Every next day, she crawled 2 cm further. Determine the total distance the snail will crawl after N days.Note. For example, the user entered the number 4. Therefore, the snail crawled for 4 days, so the total path will be 72 cm.

Task 4. To make a decision, student D. tossed a coin 9 times. If, as a result, the number of coins dropped by the "eagle" side was an even number, he made a decision in the positive direction, otherwise in the negative. Write a program that requests the number 1 or 0 (heads/tails) 9 times and gives the corresponding result of solving the student's problem.

Task 5. Display the calendar for the selected month, taking into account the specified day of the week number for the beginning of the month. Hint. The program can be divided into two parts. The first cycle will output the required number of empty cells. The second cycle will start displaying the calendar from the first day to the last day in the specified month. The transition to a new line is considered a multiple of seven with the specified offset of the day of the week. Bonus task: determine the number of days off in a given month.
